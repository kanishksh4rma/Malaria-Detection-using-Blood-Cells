Malaria is the deadliest disease in the earth and big hectic work for the health department. The traditional way of diagnosing malaria is by schematic examining blood smears of human beings for parasite-infected red blood cells under the microscope by lab or qualified technicians. This process is inefficient and the diagnosis depends on the experience and well knowledgeable person needed for the diagnosis. 

In this project, I have designed & developed a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) which automatically classifies and predicts infected cells in thin blood smears on standard microscope slides. A ten-fold cross-validation layer of the convolutional neural network on 27,558 single-cell images is used to understand the parameter of the cell.
